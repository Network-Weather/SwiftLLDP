# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied against the `main` branch and released as soon as
practical. Older tags are not maintained unless explicitly noted in the release
notes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities privately by emailing
security@network-weather.org. Provide as much detail as possible so that we can
reproduce and assess the issue quickly.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days and provide an initial
assessment within 10 days.
